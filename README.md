### Hi, I am Marton 👋

I'm glad you're here, let's see some facts about me as an introduction

 - I'm from Hungary 🇭🇺
 - I'm a coder - _implementing nice architectures and writing code literally makes me happy_
 - I'm an explorer - _hmm, a new tool? Awesome!_
 - Currently, I am working on full-stack web applications with **NodeJS** and **React**
 - Football and gym are my calm island ⚽️
 - You can read more [here](https://martondobos.hashnode.dev/) about tech tutorials, tools, and random tech-related stuff.
<br/><br/>

### What you can find here?

Mostly home projects and tech challenges.  I am always searching the Saint Graal of software development trying out new programming languages, and new tools. I believe the best way to learn is to build something with it, so my repos are about different experiences.
