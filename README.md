### Hi, I am Marton 👋

I'm glad you're here, let's see some facts about me as an introduction

 - I'm from Hungary 🇭🇺
 - I'm a coder - _implementing nice architectures and writing code literally makes me happy_
 - I'm an explorer - _hmm, a new tool? Awesome!_
 - Currently I am working on full-stack web applications with **NodeJS** and **React**
 - I am learning blockchain technology and Rust 🎓 - _love the hype_
 - Web3 and blockchain have great potential but it won't kill the current technologies 🤓
 - Football and gym are my calm islands ⚽️
 - You can read more [here](https://martondobos.hashnode.dev/) about tech tutorials, tools, and random tech-related stuff.
<br/><br/>

### What you can find here?

Mostly home projects and tech challenges.  I am always searching the Saint Graal of the software development trying out new programming languages, new tools. I belive the best way to learn something is to build something with it, so my repos are about different experiences.
