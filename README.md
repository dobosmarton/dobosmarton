## Hi, I am Marton 👋

I am a Full-stack developer from Hungary 🇭🇺. My favorite technology stack in the web world is based on an **SQL database** with a lightweight **NodeJS** backend framework. I am a huge **[@prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)** fan, so I would pick that as an ORM and a top of these I would build a nice and shiny GraphQL API layer with **TypeGraphQL** and **Apollo**. On the front-end, my favorite tool is **NextJS** with a nice front-end GraphQL client, like Apollo Client. The whole backend and front-end application would be definitely **Typescript-based**. These are my favorite tools to build awesome web applications but of course there are many more tools that would be required to build a complete product with an excellent developer experience.
